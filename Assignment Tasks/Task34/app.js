//Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in a array, and then use a for loop to print 
//the name of each pizza.
//• Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza instead of printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza 
//you should have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza.
//• Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states how much you like pizza. The output should consist of three 
//or more lines about the kinds of pizza you like and then an additional sentence, such as I really love pizza!
// Array of favorite pizza names
let pizzas = ["Pepperoni", "Margherita", "Supreme"];
// Print the name of each pizza using a for loop
console.log("Printing pizza names:");
for (let pizza of pizzas) {
    console.log(pizza);
}
// Print a sentence using the name of each pizza
console.log("\nPrinting sentences about pizza:");
for (let pizza of pizzas) {
    console.log(`I like ${pizza} pizza.`);
}
// Additional sentence expressing love for pizza
console.log("\nI really love pizza!");
